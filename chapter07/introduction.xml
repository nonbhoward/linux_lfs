  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This chapter shows how to build the last missing bits of the temporary
  system: the tools needed by the build machinery of various packages.  Now
  that all circular dependencies have been resolved, a <quote>chroot</quote>
  environment, completely isolated from the host operating system (except for
  the running kernel), can be used for the build.</para>

  <para>For proper operation of the isolated environment, some communication
  with the running kernel must be established. This is done through the
  so-called <emphasis>Virtual Kernel File Systems</emphasis>, which must be
  mounted when entering the chroot environment. You may want to check
  that they are mounted by issuing <command>findmnt</command>.</para>

  <para>Until <xref linkend="ch-tools-chroot"/>, the commands must be
  run as <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>, with the
  <envar>LFS</envar> variable set. After entering chroot, all commands
  are run as root, fortunately without access to the OS of the computer
  you built LFS on. Be careful anyway, as it is easy to destroy the whole
  LFS system with badly formed commands.</para>
